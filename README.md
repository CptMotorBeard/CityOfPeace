# CityOfPeace
A lot of my ideas for this can be found on https://github.com/CptMotorBeard/TextRPG

I started over so that I can create a good foundation for this project before adding things in. The other project will still be used for testing purposes (libraries etc.)

City of Peace will be a mostly text based city management survival RPG game.
Take control of a small settlement of survivors after the earth has been nearly annihilated.
Send crews to explore and gather resources to build up your city.
Interact with other settlemnts, whether they be friendly or not.
